## Information

### Simulated Annealing of TSP
This project was to develop a TSP heuristic to generate a solution for the TSP involving a tour of every MLB ballpark. The solution presented is a two swap neighborhood annealing approach. 

### Simulation Model of a Baseball Team
This project was to compare different hitters using discrete event simulation of a baseball game. Additionally Hill Climbing heuristic was developed to try and find a better lineup by comparing the t-distributions of runs generated over 9 innings per the candidate and neighbor solution. 

## Titanic Survival Prediction
Use of binary classifiers to train and predict whether passengers would have survived the Titanic. Involves data visualization, SciKitlearn library and ML classifiers such as Random Forest, Decision Trees and Logistic Regression.
