## Information

### Simulated Annealing of TSP
This project was to develop a TSP heuristic to generate a solution for the TSP involving a tour of every MLB ballpark. The solution presented is a two swap neighborhood annealing approach. 

### Simulation Model of a Baseball Team
This project was to compare different hitters using discrete event simulation of a baseball game. Additionally Hill Climbing heuristic was developed to try and find a better lineup by comparing the t-distributions of runs generated over 9 innings of the candidate and neighbor solution. 

### Titanic Survival Prediction
Use of binary classifiers to train and predict whether passengers would have survived the Titanic. Involves data import and cleaning using Pandas, visualization with MatPlotLib,  and ML classifiers such as Random Forest, Decision Trees and Logistic Regression using SciKitlearn.

### Stock Dashboard
This is a personal passion project developed to provide a dashboard with historical return data and forecasted pricing for a stock. Utilizes a stochastic process with transitions between positive and negative returns intraday and monte carlo simulation to create price profiles. Dashboard also uses webscraping to gather analyst opinions using Beautiful Soup.
