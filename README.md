2. Simulation model of baseball team 

## Information

### Simulated Annealing of TSP
This project was to develop a TSP heuristic to generate a solution for the TSP involving a tour of every MLB ballpark. The solution presented is a two swap neighborhood annealing approach. 

### Simulation Model of a Baseball Team
This project was to compare different hitters using discrete event simulation of a baseball game. Additionally Hill Climbing heuristic was developed to try and find a better lineup by comparing the t-distributions of runs generated over 9 innings per the candidate and neighbor solution.
